### Edit MPV configuration file <Badge text="None" type="info" />

Anikku employs the [mpv-android](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android) player, offering the ability to extensively configure its settings via a dedicated configuration file.

Anikku can also use some of mpv's keybinds, which can be configured here. <MpvLink link="https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#command-interface"/>
